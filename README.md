# Custom Temperature Sketch for Arduino Uno

Refactored Scott Fitzgerald's Chapter 3 code from Arduino Starter Kit for the following reasons:
- My first Arduino sketch
- Practice writing C functions
- Initializes base temperature instead of hardcoding 

### Other Additions
- Custom LED pin setup
- Modularization of functions 
- Commented for auto documentation
